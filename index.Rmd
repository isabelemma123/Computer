### Meet Death Grips

**Death Grips** is an experimental hiphop band with three members: *Andy Morin*, *Zach Hill* and *MC Ride*. When I got introduced to their music, I hated it. However, after torturing myself for quite some time, it grew on me. Their music is extremely energetic and, if I might say so, quite aggressive. I have not always been able to put my finger on Death Grips’ music. In most of their songs, there is so much happening at the same time: when I think I have found the rhythm, it changes again. Therefore, I am very curious what the [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com) would make out of Death Grips' music. The goal of this research is to analyze their music and by that, find out what makes Death Grips experimental.

*The Money Store* (2012) is their most popular album. However, this is without taking their first album *Exmilitary* into account. Since it is not on Spotify, it's hard to compare its popularity. With the release of *Exmilitary*, Death Grips introduced the world to a refreshing blend of punk rock, hip-hop and industrial music.

In total, Death Grips released 8 albums. *The Money Store* (2012) is their most popular album. However, this is without taking their first album *Exmilitary* into account. Since it is not on Spotify, it's hard to compare its popularity. For that same reason, I will unfortunately not be able to take *Exmilitary* into account in this research. This is a loss, since the release of *Exmilitary* introduced the world to Death Grips' refreshing blend of punk rock, hip-hop and industrial music. 

Next to the seven remaining albums, I will include their EP *Death Grips*. This EP is also an instrumental one. Therefore, it will be valuable to expand my data. And just so it has been mentioned: one of these seven albums is actually a double album and another one is an intrumental album. With data attained by [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com), I will be focussing on the following questions:

- What makes Death Grips so experimental and inaccessible? 
- How can we distinguish this ‘experimentalness’ with the data gained from [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com)?
- Is their most popular music their least experimental music?
- Has Death Grips become more experimental over time?

In summary, I will be analyzing what makes Death Grips experimental. My research will be based on the data of 7 albums and 1 EP.

### Why Death Grips gives you adrenaline

``` {r}
corpus <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "6BoVVeeH3vmrHlgivNbefW")

corpus_new <- corpus %>%
  mutate(album = factor(track.album.name, levels=c("Year Of The Snitch", "Bottomless Pit", "Interview 2016", "Fashion Week", "The Powers That B", "Government Plates", "The Money Store", "No Love Deep Web")))
ggplot(data = corpus_new, aes(x = album, y  = energy)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#00A6C7") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
    plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray25"),
    axis.line.y = element_line(arrow = grid::arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), 
                                                       ends = "both")),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Energy", limits=c(0, 1)) +
  labs(x = "Oldest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewest",
    y = "energy" ,
    title = "Energy per album" ,
    subtitle = "",
    caption = "Data source: Spotify API") +
  coord_flip() 
```

***

Before making this plot, I expected the energy levels of Death grips' music to be high. I think their music is very energetic, sometimes even too energetic for me. Maybe this is what makes the music experimental and inaccessible. 

According to the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis), energy "is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy”. I would agree that these three characteristics apply to Death Grips' tracks.

We can see very clearly that every album has a very high mean of energy, since every box is on the far right of the plot. Even though my expectations were met, I am amazed by the extremely high energy levels. Funny enough, there is one dot at around 0.37. Apparently the song *Interview E* on *Interview 2016* is Death Grips' least energetic song. 

Also, *No Love Deep Web* is quite an outlier compared to the energy levels of the rest of the albums. The median energy of this album is the lowest of all. This is their second released album. Maybe they thought they needed to refrain themselves. Wait a minute, they are **Death Grips**. They definitely did not held back on purpose.

Their music did not get less or more energetic over time. ???

So, we can state that the remarkable high energy levels of Death Grips' music is part of what makes it so aggressive and therefore experimental. This will help in researching whether their most popular music their least experimental music. I would expect that valence also contributes to aggressiveness, so that's what we'll look at in the next part.

### Why Death Grips does not make you much happier

``` {r}
corpus <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "6BoVVeeH3vmrHlgivNbefW")

corpus_new <- corpus 
ggplot(data = corpus_new, aes(x = track.album.name, y  = valence)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#00A6C7") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
    plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray25"),
    axis.line.y = element_line(arrow = grid::arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), 
                                                       ends = "both")),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Valence", limits=c(0, 1)) +
  labs(x = "Oldest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewest",
    y = "Valence" ,
    title = "Valence per album" ,
    subtitle = "",
    caption = "Data source: Spotify API") +
  coord_flip() 
```


***

According to the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features), valence is a "measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."

It becomes clear that *Interviews 2016* is Death Grips' happiest album. It is an instrumental album, which would lead us to the conclusion that maybe MC Ride has a big role in making the music sad and/or angry. However, the other instrumental album *Fashion Week* has a much lower valence than *Interviews 2016*. It is maybe a bit misleading that there are three points not included in the box of *Fashion Week*, but the median valence of the album is still low.

*The Powers that B* is their least happy album. However, reflecting the information of the previous plot about energy, this album was also the most energetic one. Combining these plots about energy and valence makes me conclude that *The Powers That B* is Death Grips' most aggressive album.

Death Grips' most popular song is *Get Got*. It's a very energetic and catchy song. Its chromagram is just as messy as the song. However, it is not weird for a chromagram of a hiphop song to look like this, since we distinguish hip-hop mostly by its rythm and that's the part that the chromagram shows least. 

- The first ten seconds of the song contains the most clear key of the song: A#/Bb. In this short section, we can hear one melody and MC Ride rapping. 

- After 10 seconds, MC Ride stops rapping and the melody changes. There is more happening in this new melody compared to the previous one.

- In between and 22 seconds, the chromagram shows mostly a D key. After these 22 second, MC Ride starts rapping again over the same melody we heard in the previous section.

- At 36 seconds, the melody transposes. In this section we see A#/Bb, B and C light up more, instead of A and D.

I found out albums where MC Ride is rapping, do not work well in chordograms. Those chordograms show up almost completely dark blue. I think this is caused by the rapid- and choaticness of the music combined by the fact that ...

Luckily, I've included two instrumental albums in my corpus. MC Ride may fool the chordograms, but Zach and Andy provide us more clear ones. After a long search (thanks to Death Grips for making ungraspable music), I finally found a song that shows a clear melody: *Runway H*.

The sections with bright yellow contain a very sharp sound. Remember, bright yellow means that it is **not** that chord. Consequently, the most dark blue means it is definitely that chord.

According to a reddit discussion, it is suggested that *Fuck Me Out* and *Hot Head* are two of Death Grips' most experimental songs. Let's see if we can find out why they are experimental, according to their cepstrograms.

***Fuck Me Out***

On first glance, it is clear that there is much going on in c02. According to the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis), this second basic function emphasizes **brightness**. This brightness should not be confused with lightness or easy listening: "In audio production brightness refers to upper mid and high frequency content. Increased levels of mid and high frequency content are referred to as brighter" ([Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-defines-brightness-darkness-in-music-Are-these-properties-considered-color-or-harmonics-both-or-none-of-the-above)). I do recognize this in *Fuck Me Out*.

- In section 0-40 seconds and section 60-90 seconds, coefficients 3 and 4 alternate. Explain...

- Between 100 and 130 seconds, c02 is extra bright. In this section, a hihat plays loud and frequently. I think this hihat shows in c02, because it has a high pitch and loudness, which makes it bright.

***Hot Head***

First, notice the similarities of the two cepstrograms. This suggests that both *Fuck Me Out* and *Hot Head* are songs with a lot of brightness. However, *Hot Head*'s cepstrogram does differ from the one of *Fuck Me Out*: it bleeds out more to c01 & c03, and c06 lights up significantly more. 

A relevant sidenote is that *Hot Head*'s cepstrogram looks more detailed. Why? I think it's because the song is simply longer than *Fuck Me Out*, almost a full minute. Therefore, there is more information in the same plot size, which makes it more detailed.

Looks like the timbre of *Fuck me Out* is quite similar to itself. Notice how the section between 110 - 130 seconds lights up yellow/green. This means that this section has less similarity to the rest of the song. We've also seen the same section light up in the previous cepstrogram. I stated that this section has a very loud and frequently played hihat. This type of hihat can only be heard in this section of the song, which causes it to be less similar to the rest of the song.

*Hot Head* is even more extremely self-similar than *Fuck Me Out*. The ending is the most "unique" compared to the rest of the song, because we can hear just one note getting louder and higher. This sound is heard often throughout the rest of the song, but then it's probably overruled by other sounds we can hear. These other sounds are absent in the last few seconds of the song, which is why the API reads those last few seconds as less similar to the rest of the song.

Somehow I expected an experimental song to differ from itself at various moments. However, after seeing these self-similarity matrices, it makes sense. I think the songs are still very experimental, just the same experimentalness throughout the song. There is so much happening in the songs, that the fact that the same thing is happening throughout the song does not make the songs less experimental: you still won't get used to the chaotic sounds.

On the left we see a novelty function of loudness, of the song *Up My Sleeves*. A novelty (read: change) in the song, causes a peak. The higher the peak, the higher the change in, in this case, loudness.

In between 25-30 seconds, we see the same type of novelties. This is due to the fact that the sentence "up my sleeves" is being repeated. At 30 seconds, the vocals stop and the melody of the song starts. The novelties in between 30-50 seconds look quite irregular, it is hard to find a tempo. *Up My Sleeves* is, once again, an energetic song with almost no silences in the main melody. There is almost no silence in between 35-50 seconds, nor in the melody. When there is music followed by silence (or the other way around), the change in loudness is high. Therefore, you would expect a high novelty when the music stops and also when it starts again. But since there are almost no silences in the melody, my expectations that the novelties in the main part of the song would not be high, were right.

### Tempogram

***

According to the Fourier-based tempogram of *Up My Sleeves*, the tempo of the song changes very often, except for the parts where the main melody is missing (0-30 seconds and 266-292 seconds). In those parts, the tempo is probably 145 beats per minute.


### Conclusion

***What makes Death Grips experimental?***

We've seen that **Death Grips**' music is energetic and sad, which equals aggression. I am very convinced that this is part of what makes Death Grips experimental. Ofcourse, a lot of music is aggressive, but Death Grips introduced a new type of aggression with their evolutionary blend of punk rock, hip-hop and industrial music.

However, their experimentalness does not show in change or uniqueness within songs. We've seen that *Fuck Me Out* is quite similar to itself. Furthermore, *Up My Sleeves* did not contain huge novelties in loudness. Looks like there is still room for Death Grips to reinvent themselves and become even more experimental, inaccesible and unlistenable ;)
