**Death Grips** is an experimental hiphop band with three members. When I got introduced to their music, I hated it. However, after torturing myself for quite some time, it grew on me. Their music is extremely energetic and, if I might say so, quite aggressive. I have not always been able to put my finger on Death Grips’ music. When I think I have found the rhythm, it changes again. This is one of the reasons why I am very curious what the Spotify API makes out of it. 

The Money Store (2012) is their most popular album. In total, they released 8 albums, including one instrumental album and a mixtape. I chose to exclude the mixtape "Exmilitary", because it is not on Spotify (it includes uncleared samples). I want to compare the different albums throughout the years. What is the common change throughout these albums? Has Death Grips become more experimental? How can we distinguish this ‘experimentalness’ with the data gained from Spotify’s API?

In 2015, two of the three members released music under a different band name: **The I.L.Y’s**. The singer/rapper of Death Grips (MC Ride) is not involved in this project. I have the feeling that this causes The I.L.Y’s to be less experimental and less energetic than Death Grips. I believe that that is one of the reasons why The I.L.Y’s are more listenable than Death Grips. However, Death Grips is much more popular than The I.L.Y’s. I want to compare Death Grips with The I.L.Y’s. Additionally, I want to put the three I.L.Y’s albums in between the Death Grips albums (chronological order) to see if there are similarities within the changes both bands go through.

In summary, I will be researching and comparing two bands: Death Grips (7 albums) and The I.L.Y's (3 albums). My goal is to discover i) the differences between the bands, ii) the change both bands went through seperately, iii) if there are similarities in these changes between the two bands
